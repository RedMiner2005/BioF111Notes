# Experiment 1: Protein estimation
* Can be qualitative or quantitative
* Different methods:
  * **Folin-Lowry**: (We're using this) Measure at any wavelength between 650 and 750 nm, but best to measure at 750 nm. Endpoint assay with a stable result, so you can compare it to a previous standard curve. Not compatible with a lot of common chemicals like EDTA, carbs, reducing agents, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. The Folin phenol reagent *has* to be added to each sample precisely at the end of the 10-min incubation period.
  * **Bradford**: Quick, easy to set up, stable upto an hour, isn't affected by reducing agents in buffer. Basic conditions may interfere
  * **Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA)**: Peptide bond is involved so amino acid composition doesn't affect it much, not sensitive to detergents and denaturants. But reducing agents can interfere, and it takes time to proceed
  * **Warburg-Christian**
* We choose one of the above based on sensitivity, presence of interfering substances, time availability of assay, etc.
* The method we use - Folin-Lowry - depends on the presence of aromatic rings in the amino acid (pheylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine)
* Biuret reagent: NaOH, hydrated CuSO<sub>4</sub>
* Folin-Ciocalteu: mixture of sodium molybdate, sodium tungstate
* The sample is Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
* The sample is treated first with Biuret, when Cu<sup>2+</sup> reacts with the N in peptide bonds in alkaline conditions, and chelates with copper ions by Cu<sup>2+</sup> -> Cu<sup>+</sup>
* The F.C. reagent is then ...?

> Incomplete notes, now I'll just add points from here and there

# Random points
* The first thing that happens to a plant in a hypertonic environment: Flaccid -> Plasmolysis -> Cytorhysis. Equivalent shrinking in animal cells: crenation
* Glucagon: Increases glucose levels in blood, increases during fasting. It stimulates the secretion of ghrelin which will simulate a feeding response. Given to Type 1 diabetes. Opposite function of insulin, converts glycogen to glucose (insulin does reverse).
* Immersion oil slide preparation: Refractive index = glass slide, so more resolving power. Used for 100x magnification
* Phenols reduce Phosphomolybdicphosphotungstic acid to give heteropolymolybdenum
* Biuret reaction: Chelation happens in alkaline conditions
* Biuret reaction is not specific to amino acids, the Folin-Ciocalteu reaction is.
* Blue-green and red algae lack chlorophyll b. Only found in plants and green algae
* Two covalent and two coordinate bonds to Mg<sup>2+</sup> in chlorophyll.
  * At C7 of pyrrole ring IV, a phytol tail (20C) is attached (through a propionic ester bond). Useful in orientation and anchoring of chlorophyll.
  * At C3 of pyrrole ring II, -CH<sub>3</sub> inn chlorophyll a, and aldehyde in chlorophyll b.
  * b is an accessory, transfers energy to a, about 2-3 more a than b in plants.
  * a found in all.
  * The fifth isocyclic ring is the chemically active site with only carbons
  * a: blue-green, b: yellow-green
  * a: soluble in petroleum, b: soluble in methyl alcohol
  * Xanthophyll: yellow, carotene: yellow-orange.
* Cytolysis: hypotonic, cell bursts. Crenation(animals)/Cytorrhysis(plants): hypertonic
* Biuret reagent is enhanced by alkaline
* Rf: Retention factor
* Extreme dehydration -> drink salt+sugar mixed water, or water packed with electrolytes (Isotonic condition for cells)
* Minimum resolvable distance, where N: RI of the medium between sample and lens, $\alpha$ is the aperture angle of the objective lens:
$$D_{min} = \dfrac{0.5\lambda}{N sin\alpha}$$
