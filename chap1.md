# Chapter 1, 2, 3: Introduction and Chemistry
## Process of Science
* Discovery Science
  * Seeking natural causes for natural phenomena
  * Verifiable observations and measurements, such as Charles Darwin's description of plants and animals in South America, Jane Goodall's description of behaviour of chimpanzees
* Hypothesis-driven science:
  * Hypothesis: tentative answer to a question, proposed explanation for a set of observations
  * Good hypothesis -> predictions that can be tested by experiments and should be falsifiable
  * Theories: Tie together multiple hypotheses by providing a backbone that explains them
  * Theories are only widely accepted if they are backed by extensive and varied evidence and not been contradicted by scientific data

## Properties of Life
1. **Order**: Ordered organization: Cell organelles -> Cells -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ system -> Organism
2. **Regulation**: Adjust internal environment in response to the environmental conditions, such as a lizard basking on a rock when it senses its temperature dropping
3. **Growth and Development**: Information carried by DNA controls the pattern of growth and Development
4. **Energy processing**: Organisms take in energy and use it to perform all life activities, emit energy as heat
5. **Response to the environment**: Well, they respond to external stimuli
6. **Reproduction**: They have the machinery to reproduce their own kind
7. **Evolution**: Reproduction underlies the capacity of the population to change over time.

## Ecosystems
* Environment with physical and living parts
* Depends on two main processes - recycling of chemical nutrients, flow of energy: doesn't get recycled and the ecosystem loses and gains energy
* Mainly 3 modes of nutrition in which both happen: photosynthetic organisms, consumers (of either plants or animals), decomposers (break down remains of dead organisms, recycle nutrients)

## Domains of Life
1. Archea (prokaryotic)
2. Bacteria (prokaryotic)
3. Eukarya (eukaryotic)
  * Kingdoms:
    1. Plantae
    2. Fungi
    3. Animalia
    4. Protists (multiple kingdoms)

## Natural Selection
* Overproduction and competition: Too many offspring -> competition for resources
* Individual variation: Variation in inherited traits among individuals -> some random mutations may help some individuals survive certain circumstances

> [!NOTE]
> Trans fats: produced by hydrogenation of fat, since it adds texture, increases shelf life, inexpensive to prepare. They get collected in the adipose tissue and it seems to lead to double the risk of heart attack

> [!NOTE]
> Antibiotic resistant bacteria arise when some bacteria have random mutations that help them survive antibiotics. They then get naturally selected. In some cases - the bacteria will be able to destroy the antibiotics, and sometimes even consume them as food. Methicillin-resistant _Staphlococcus aureus_ or MRSA - relatively common, can spread via skin-to-skin contact in contact sports. Not having the full course of antibiotics or needlessly having them increasing the chances of this happening. 

# Organic Compounds
* Larger organic compounds are the main moleculaes in gasoline as well as our body. In fact, th energy-rich parts of fat molecules have structures similar to gasoline
* Many of life's molecules are gigantic - _macromolecules_ (polymers)
* Trace elements: < 0.01% of our weight, but we cannot live without them (such as iodine, fluorine, iron)
* Anabolism: making complex molecules (usually polymers) from simpler ones, usually using dehydration
* Catabolism: Polymers -> Monomers using hydrolysis

## Carbohydrates
* Include sugars and polymers of sugars
* For animals: primary source of energy, raw material for manufacturing some kinds of organic compounds
* For plants: serve as building material
* Monosaccharides, especially glucose: main for cellular work
  * Glucose and fructose: both found in honey, fruits
* In aqueous solution, glucose is most likely found as rings instead of in its linear form
* Dissacharides:
  * Sucrose: Glucose + Fructose 
  * Lactose: Galactose + Glucose
  * Maltose: Glucose + Glucose
* Polysaccharides:
  * Starch: long chain of glucose, energy storage by plants
  * Glycogen: Animal energy storage, mostly stored in liver and near muscles, hence why athletes have a carbo load
  * Cellulose: Most abundant organic compound, forms cable like fibrils in cell walls. Cannot be broken by animals, and grazing animals get them broken down by microorganisms in their digestive tract. Multiple hydrogen bonds between polymers
* Most carbohydrates are hydrophilic, and even though cellulose doesn't dissokve in water, water can adhere to its surface, which is why a fluffy bath towel is so water absorbent

## Lipids
* Hydrophobic, they aren't as huge as the other macromolecules nor are they polymers of repeating monomers
* Fat/triglyceride: 
  * Glycerol + 3 fatty acids via dehydration
  * Energy storage, cushioning, insulation
  * If it has fewer than the max number of hydrogen atoms possible (ie, multiple bonds): unsaturated
  * Max number of hydrogens in all 3 of its fatty acids: saturated fat. Easier to stack up because they are straighter.
  * Most animal fats: High proportion of sat. fatty acids. Can easily stack up, solid at room temp -> **atherosclerosis** or build up of lipid containing plaques along inside walls of blood vessels
  * Most plant and fish fats: high in unsat. fatty acids, liquid at room temp. Tropical plants: exception, such as cocoa butter which has a mix of sat. and unsat. fats that give chocolate its melting point close to room temp, but low enough to melt in out mouth.
  * Hydrogenation: adds H, converts unsat. -> sat. fats, makes liquid fats solid, creates trans fat
  * Highly energy efficient: double energy stored when compared to carbohydrates, making it harder to use them up.
  * Stored in adipose tissue.
* Steroids:
  * Has four fused rings
  * Vary in thee functional groups attached to these rings
  * Cholesterol: key component of membranes, base steroid from which other steroids are produced such as estrogen and testosterone
  * **Structures** (these 3 have two other CH<sub>3</sub> groups attached as well):
    * Cholesterol: A carbon chain on the 5-C ring, an OH on the opposite 6-C ring.
    * Testosterone: OH on the 5-C ring, =O on the opposite 6-C ring.
    * Estrogen: =O on the 5-C ring, OH on the opposite 6-C ring.
  * Synthetic anabolic steroids:
    * Variants of testosterone and mimic some of its effects
    * may be prescribed to treat diseases such as cancer or AIDS.
    * Abused by athletes to build up muscles pretty quickly. THG (Tetrahydrogestrinone): nicknames 'The Clear' as it was hard to detect. Structure is similar to testosterone

## Proteins
* Polymers of amino acid monomers
* Account for more than 50% of the dry weight of most cells.
* Major types: Structural, storage, contractile, transport, enzymes
* All proteins are made up of only 20 amino acids.
* Amino acids: Contains -COOH, -NH<sub>2</sub>, a hydrogen atom and a variable group attached to one C atom.
* The variable group gives the amino acids their properties such as hydrophobicity (leucine) or hydrophilicity (serine)
* Peptide bonds (dehydration of -COOH of one and -NH<sub>2</sub> of another amino acid) join the amino acids to form polypeptides.
* A single amino acid substitution causes sickle cell disease (6th amino acid in the primary structure of amino acid) (such an abnormality makes the haemoglobin crystallize): the angular cells lead to clogging of tiny blood vessels.
* Protein shape: Sensitive to temperature, pH, all of which can unravel a protein.
  1. Primary structure: Polypeptide sequence
  2. Secondary structure: Local stretches of the sequence may form local patterns which are alpha helix and beta-pleated sheets. Hydrogen bonds are responsible.
  3. Tertiary structure: Overall 3D shape of the single polypeptide, due to chemical bonds like disulphide bond.
  4. Quaternary structure: Proteins with more than one polypeptide chains.
* The shape of a protein is responsible for its function.
* **Denaturation of a protein**: High temperature breaks the 3D structure of the proteins, stops functioning properly. Example: egg white: clear -> opaque when heated. High fevers are dangerous for the same reason.
* Misfolded proteins: Diseases such as Alzheimer's, mad cow (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob: All of these due to prions (misfolded proteins) turning regular proteins into more prions

## Nucleic acids
* Two types: DNA, RNA
* Gene: Unit of inheritance that programs the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide.
* Monomer: nucleotides which have 3 parts:
  * 5-C sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA)
  * Phosphate
  * A nitrogen containing base (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine) which hang off the backbone like appendages
* Monomers are linked together forming a covalent bond between an -OH at 3' of the sugar and one of the oxygens of the phosphate group at 5', forming the sugar-phosphate backbone.
* DNA and RNA both are polymers of nucleotides, but:
  * RNA sugar is ribose, DNA is deoxyribose
  * Instead of thymine of DNA, RNA has uracil
  * RNA usually single stranded, DNA double stranded (the two strands are complementary to each other, A=T, Gâ‰¡C)

### Enzymes
* Metabolism: Total of all chemical reactions of an organism.
* Most reactions require the assistance of enzymes to lower the activation energy without getting consumed themselves.
* By introducing random mutations in the genes of a particular enzyme and screening the parts that show the activity that we want over multiple rounds, we can create new enzymes.
* Enzymes: Very selective. Each recognize a substrate. The active site has a shape and chemistry that fits the substrate, and the interaction is called induced fit because the entry of the substrate induces a slight change in the shape of the enzyme.
* Many enzymes are named with an '-ase' suffix.
* Enzymes can be used repeatedly, since it will release the products from the active site ready to accept another substrate molecule.

* Enzyme inhibitors:
  * By binding to the enzyme, certain molecules may disrupt its function
  * It can bind to the active site since it would have a shape similar to that of the substrate, blocking the substrate (competitive inhibition)
  * It can bind to an allosteric site which is a site distinct from the active site, changing the shape of the enzyme
  * Sometimes the binding of inhibitors may be reversible, and may even be used to limit the reactions in the presence of excess of the products
  * Penicillin works by blocking the active site of an enzyme used by bacteria in making cell walls
  * Ibuprofen: Inhibits an enzyme involved in sending pain signals
  * Many cancer drugs: inhibit enzymes that promote cell division
  * Negative Feedback inhibition: A -> B -> C -> D -> End product -> Inhibits B-ase. That is, end product accumulation leads to it binding to an enzyme early in the sequence. Keeps the end product within a certain range

> [!NOTE]
> Lactose intolerance is caused by a change in a nucleotide approximately 14,000 nucleotides away from the gene that codes for lactase. C at that site -> lactose intolerance, T at that site -> lactose tolerance
