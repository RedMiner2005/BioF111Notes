# Chapter 1, 2: Introduction and Chemistry
## Process of Science
* Discovery Science
  * Seeking natural causes for natural phenomena
  * Verifiable observations and measurements, such as Charles Darwin's description of plants and animals in South America, Jane Goodall's description of behaviour of chimpanzees
* Hypothesis-driven science:
  * Hypothesis: tentative answer to a question, proposed explanation for a set of observations
  * Good hypothesis -> predictions that can be tested by experiments and should be falsifiable
  * Theories: Tie together multiple hypotheses by providing a backbone that explains them
  * Theories are only widely accepted if they are backed by extensive and varied evidence and not been contradicted by scientific data

## Properties of Life
1. **Order**: Ordered organization: Cell organelles -> Cells -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ system -> Organism
2. **Regulation**: Adjust internal environment in response to the environmental conditions, such as a lizard basking on a rock when it senses its temperature dropping
3. **Growth and Development**: Information carried by DNA controls the pattern of growth and Development
4. **Energy processing**: Organisms take in energy and use it to perform all life activities, emit energy as heat
5. **Response to the environment**: Well, they respond to external stimuli
6. **Reproduction**: They have the machinery to reproduce their own kind
7. **Evolution**: Reproduction underlies the capacity of the population to change over time.

## Domains of Life
1. Archea (prokaryotic)
2. Bacteria (prokaryotic)
3. Eukarya (eukaryotic)
  * Kingdoms:
    1. Plantae
    2. Fungi
    3. Animalia
    4. Protists (multiple kingdoms)


# Organic Compounds
* Larger organic compounds are the main moleculaes in gasoline as well as our body. In fact, th energy-rich parts of fat molecules have structures similar to gasoline
