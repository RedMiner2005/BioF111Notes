# How Genes are Controlled

## Gene Regulation: Introduction
* All somatic cells have the same DNA as the zygote. Different genes are expressed in different tissues with the help of _gene regulation_
* "Houskeeping" genes are always expressed, but other specialized features are only turned on if required by that cell type.\

## Gene Regulation: _Escheria coli_
* E. coli in intestine; if there is a rush of lactose, it expresses three genes for enzymes to digest this and absorb this sugar: lacZ, lacY, lacA. These are turned off when lactose levels drop
* Such a cluster of related genes that are adjacent to each other and regulated as a single unit is called an **operon**
* Order of genes on a stretch of DNA: Regulatory gene (for creating a repressor) -> Promoter (where the RNA polymerase will attach and start transcription) -> Operator (where the repressor can attach and prevent expression of the operon) -> Genes to be expressed
* The repressor for the lac operon has a site for lactose to bind to the protein, which changes its shape and detaches it from the operator, unblocking that stretch of DNA.

* Similarly, in many other bacteria also, many operons have been discovered. However, some of them different mechanisms: some operons for amino acid synthesis have their repressors activated in the presence of the same amino acid, to prevent excess production.

## Gene Regulation: Eukaryotes (Introduction)
* Pathway from gene to protein has a number of processes that can each be turned on or off, or whose speeds can be controlled.

## DNA Packing
* Eukaryotic chromosomes may be in a condensed state, which prevents RNA polymerases and other transcription enzymes from attaching.
* May be used for long term deactivation of genes.
* One of the female X chromosomes is deactivated early in embryonic development, in random in each of those cells. This leads to that X chromosome compacting to a high extent. All descendants of that cell will have the same deactivated X chromosome -> if a gene has two different versions in the two chromosomes, then about half her cells will express one version and the other half will express the other one.

## Intiation of Transcription
* Most important for gene regulation 
* Involves a lot of proteins (collectively called _transcription factors_)
* Repressors are less common than **activators** which turn on the gene. This is more efficient because the default state of most genes is 'off' (except for a few housekeeping genes) and only a small percentage of genes need to be expressed.

* General transcription factors bind to the promoters and these help the RNA polymerase to bind to the DNA. Activators may:
  * bind to the regulatory region and instruct the RNA polymerase to start transcription.
  * bind to distant regions (called the **enhancer regions**) and attach to the general transcription factor with the help of a mediator molecule to initiate transcription.
  * unwind the wound chromatin so that RNA polymerase can bind to it
* Repressors are another type of transcription factors which may:
  * bind to the binding site of the activators (regulatory/enhancer regions)
  * interfere with the molecular interaction between the activator and the RNA polymerase
  * coil up the chromatin to prevent RNA polymerase from binding
* The interaction of all these is what determines the actual rate of DNA transcription.
