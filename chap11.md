# How Genes are Controlled

## Gene Regulation: Introduction
* All somatic cells have the same DNA as the zygote. Different genes are expressed in different tissues with the help of _gene regulation_
* "Houskeeping" genes are always expressed, but other specialized features are only turned on if required by that cell type.\

## Gene Regulation: _Escheria coli_
* E. coli in intestine; if there is a rush of lactose, it expresses three genes for enzymes to digest this and absorb this sugar: lacZ, lacY, lacA. These are turned off when lactose levels drop
* Such a cluster of related genes that are adjacent to each other and regulated as a single unit is called an **operon**
* Order of genes on a stretch of DNA: Regulatory gene (for creating a repressor) -> Promoter (where the RNA polymerase will attach and start transcription) -> Operator (where the repressor can attach and prevent expression of the operon) -> Genes to be expressed
* The repressor for the lac operon has a site for lactose to bind to the protein, which changes its shape and detaches it from the operator, unblocking that stretch of DNA.

* Similarly, in many other bacteria also, many operons have been discovered. However, some of them different mechanisms: some operons for amino acid synthesis have their repressors activated in the presence of the same amino acid, to prevent excess production.

## Gene Regulation: Eukaryotes (Introduction)
* Pathway from gene to protein has a number of processes that can each be turned on or off, or whose speeds can be controlled.

### DNA Packing
* Eukaryotic chromosomes may be in a condensed state, which prevents RNA polymerases and other transcription enzymes from attaching.
* May be used for long term deactivation of genes.
* **Epigenetic mechanism:**One of the female X chromosomes is deactivated early in embryonic development, in random in each of those cells. This leads to that X chromosome compacting to a high extent. All descendants of that cell will have the same deactivated X chromosome -> if a gene has two different versions in the two chromosomes, then about half her cells will express one version and the other half will express the other one. Effect can be seen on cats: tortoiseshell pattern

### Intiation of Transcription
* Most important for gene regulation 
* Involves a lot of proteins (collectively called _transcription factors_)
* Repressors are less common than **activators** which turn on the gene. This is more efficient because the default state of most genes is 'off' (except for a few housekeeping genes) and only a small percentage of genes need to be expressed.
* Check [this](https://youtu.be/uths1TU1N_c) out.
* General transcription factors bind to the promoters and these help the RNA polymerase to bind to the DNA. Activators may:
  * bind to the regulatory region and instruct the RNA polymerase to start transcription.
  * bind to distant regions (called the **enhancer regions**) and attach to the general transcription factor with the help of a mediator molecule to initiate transcription.
  * unwind the wound chromatin so that RNA polymerase can bind to it
* Repressors are another type of transcription factors which may:
  * bind to the binding site of the activators (regulatory/enhancer regions)
  * interfere with the molecular interaction between the activator and the RNA polymerase
  * coil up the chromatin to prevent RNA polymerase from binding
* The interaction of all these is what determines the actual rate of DNA transcription.

### RNA Processing and Breakdown
* RNA processing involves the addition of cap and tail, and the removal of non-coding DNA segments (introns)
* Exon splicing can occur in many ways: _alternative RNA splicing_ -> an organism can produce more than one polypeptide from the same gene.
* Typical human gene: 10 exons
* After the production of mRNA, its lifetime can be from hours to weeks and the controlled breakdown provides for another opportunity for regulation 
  * **microRNAs (miRNAs):** Can bind to complementary sequences on mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm. After binding, some trigger the breakdown of their target mRNA, others block translation. miRNAs may regulate half of all human genes.
  * RNA interference: injection of small RNAs to artificially turn off specific genes.

### Initiation of Translation, Protein Activation and Breakdown
* Translation - more control by regulatory molecules. Example: RBCs do not produce hemoglobin unless it has a supply of heme.
* After translation: insulin is produced as one long inactive polypeptide that must be chopped to pieces to activate it.
* Selective breakdown of proteins such as those for metabolic changes.

## Cell Signaling
* **Signal Transduction Pathway**: Signal molecule from signalling cell -> Receptor protein on the cell membrane -> Relay proteins -> Activate the transcription factor -> Transcription -> Translation. Becomes very important in early embryonic development along with gene regulation.
* **Homeotic genes:** Master control genes, regulate groups of genes to determine which body part develops where. Example: one set of homeotic genes instruct the midbody of a fruitfly to form legs. Everywhere else, these genes are turned off. Mutations may lead to legs on their heads (which does happen). Similar homeotic genes found in nearly every eukaryote.

## DNA Microarray
* Slide with thousands of different kinds of _single stranded_ DNA fragments in a tightly spaced grid.
* All the mRNAs transcribed in a particular cell type are collected and mixed with a reverse transcriptase to produce complementary DNA to each mRNA sequence (cDNA) which are synthesised using nucleotides that glow.
* A small amount of this is added to the DNA fragments in the microarray and if the cDNA is complementary to it, it binds. Else it gets washed off.
* This helps determine which genes were expressed.
