# Chapter 4 - A tour of the cell
## Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria - Superbugs
* Most antibiotics: naturally-occurring chemicals from microorganisms.
* Isolation of penicillin - 1928, first one.
* Most antibiotics operate by binding to bacteria-specific structures, so that they don't affect human cells.
  * Erithromycin, Streptomycin: bind to bacterial ribosome, which are rather different form human ribosome.
  * Ciproflaxin: against anthrax-causing bacteria, targets an enzyme that bacteria need to maintain their chromosome structure.
  * Penicillin, ampicillin, bacitracin: disrupt cell wall synthesis, which is absent in animals anyway.
* One particular example: _Staphylococcus aureus_:
  * They are commonly found on the skin, and when they multiply and cause infections, they actually secrete PSM proteins which go in through immune cell pores and create holes in the cell membrane causing it to burst.
  * Staph infections usually happen in hospitals, can cause pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease: the tissue just under the skin such as muscles at times, may be damaged by bacteria that enter through a break in the skin.)
  * But a more dangerous strain: _Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is resistant to the antibiotic methicillin and also spreads outside of hospital settings such as gyms. A ajor portion of how it operates is the same PSM protein, but an MRSA infection might also have other factors.

## Microscopic World of Cells
* Organisms are either single-celled, or multi-celled (plants, most fungi, animals)
* Microscopes:
  * Simplest (and the first kind to be used): light microscope. Useful for observing living cells.
  * Two important factors: magnification and resolving power.
  * Electron microscopes have about 100x more resolving power than light microscopes, but they involve killing the specimen and preserving it with a chemical fixative first. 
  * Scanning electron microscope: for cell surface
  * Transmission electron microscope: for cell internals
* **Cell theory**: All living things are composed of cells and all cells come from earlier cells

## Major Categories of Cells
* Prokaryotic:
  * Smaller, simpler
  * Lack membrane-bound organelles
  * Found in bacteria and archaea
  * Cytoplasm: entire cell interior
  * Single circular chromosome in the nucleoid region.
  * First evolved around 3.5B years ago.
  * Most by cell walls, some have capsules, pili and/or flagella. (Pili: short hair-like appendages, flagella: long, helical appendages that protrude through the cell membrane)
* Eukaryotic:
  * Larger, more complex
  * Have membrane-bound organelles. (most important difference, incl. nucleus, which is double-membraned, houses most of the cell DNA)
  * Found in protists, fungi, animals, plants.
  * Cytoplasm: region between nucleus and plasma membrane
  * One or more linear chromosomes
  * First evolved around 2.1B years ago
  * Plant cells are surrounded by cell walls, animal: extracellular matrix
* All cells:
  * Plasma membrane: boundary, regulates traffic in and out of cells.
  * Inside cells: thick, jelly-like fluid: **cytosol** (all cellular components are suspended in it.)
  * One or more chromosomes, and have ribosomes (but structure differs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes)

> [!NOTE]
> * Pili: short hair-like appendages, but not membrane-bound organelles (surface-bound external filaments). Some pili: capable of extension and retraction. Can exchange DNA, so it used for sexual reproduction in bacteria.
> * Cilia: shorter hair-like appendages. Only found in Eukaryotic cells, and only they move with the help of cilia.
> * Flagella: Not membrane-bound organelles, helical appendages that protrude through the cell membrane. Some special flagella: sensory organs that can sense changes in pH and temperature.
> * Refer to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680979/#:~:text=The%20bacterial%20flagellar%20motor%20is,revolutions%20per%20second%20in%20E.) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nZYlyFGm50) for flagellar movement 

> [!NOTE]
> * Bacterial capsule: hydrated polysaccharide structure that covers the outer layer of the cell wall, mostly composed with monosaccharides via glycosidic, but sometimes amino acids, and protein-carbohydrate capsules are also found.
> * Extracellular matrix: Structural support network with diverse proteins, sugars, and other compounds.

## Overview of Eukaryotic Cells
* Differences in the organelles of plant and animal cells:
  * Plants: Central vacuole, cell wall, chloroplast
    * Central vacuole: Sac-like, surrounded by a phospholipid membrane. Functions as a storage tank for water (regulating turgor pressure) and other molecules, including toxic compounds at times like *nicotine* and *calcium oxalate* making them toxic to certain predators.
    * Cell wall: Rigid external layer, mainly composed of cellulose microfibrils.
    * Chloroplast: Well, learn it in detail in the photosynthesis chapter.
  * Animals: Centrioles, Lysosomes
    * Centrioles: Paired barrel-shaped organelles (one pair forms a centrosome), organize microtubules that serve as the cell's skeletal system.Help determine the locations of nucleus and other organelles. In plant cells, origin of spindle fibres is not that well known, in animals, they extend from centrioles.
    * Lysosomes: will be covered.

## Plasma Membrane
* Mostly composed of phospholipids, as a bilayer
  * 'Head' with a negatively charged phosphate
  * Two (instead of 3, the third spot is where the phosphate group is) non-polar fatty acids 'tails'
* Help regulate traffic across the membrane. There are proteins embedded in the fluid-mosaic that do this. 
* It is a fluid-mosaic because molecules can move freely past one another and there is a diversity of proteins in the membrane.

## Cell Surfaces
* Plant cells have an extra cell wall (cellulose)(protect cell, maintain its shape, kepp cells from absorbing too much water) outside the cell membrane, and animal cells have a sticky coat called the extracellular matrix (most cells).
* Fibres made of collagen hold cells together in tissues, and can have protective and supportive functions.
* Surfaces of most animal cells: Cell junctions: connect cells together into tissues, allowing cells to function in a coordinated way.

## Nucleus, Ribosome
* Nucleus: double membrane (each similar to plasma membrane structure): **nuclear envelope**
* Pores in the membrane: material can pass out to and from the cytoplasm.
* Long DNA molecules and associated proteins form fibers called chromatin. Each long chromatin fiber - one chromosome. Number of chromosomes depends on the species (23 pairs for human body cell, 24 for rice, 78 for dogs)
* Nucleolus: site in nucleus where ribosomes are made.
* Ribosomes: Responsible for protein synthesis
* In eukaryotic cells, their components are made in the nucleolus, then transported through the pores of the nucleus.
* They begin working in the cytoplasm.
* Some suspended in the cytosol making proteins that will remain in the fluid of cell.
* Others attached to endoplasmic reticulum, making proteins that are incorporated into membranes or secreted out of the cell. (Still structurally identical to the other kind)
* Transcription and translation explained in detail in chapter 10 and 11

## Endomembrane System
* Cytoplasm is partitioned by organelle membranes, some of which are connected directly by membranes or by transfer of membrane segments (vesicles: sacs of membrane).
* Nuclear envelop, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum 
* Forms an extensive labyrinth of tubes and sacs running though the cytoplasm.
* Membrane separates internal ER and cytosol.
* Two components: rough and smooth ER.
* Rough ER: 
  * Ribosomes that stud the outside of the membrane.
  * One function: Make more membrane.
  * Phospholipids made by rough ER enzymes are inserted into the ER membrane, growing the ER and passing portions to other parts of cell.
  * Ribosomes on the surface: produce proteins that will be inserted into the ER, transported to other organelles and eventually exported.
  * Cells that secrete a lot of protein: rich in rough ER.
