# Chapter 4 - A tour of the cell
## Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria
* Most antibiotics: naturally-occurring chemicals from microorganisms.
* Isolation of penicillin - 1928, first one.
* Most antibiotics operate by binding to bacteria-specific structures, so that they don't affect human cells.
  * Erithromycin, Streptomycin: bind to bacterial ribosome, which are rather different form human ribosome.
  * Ciproflaxin: against anthrax-causing bacteria, targets an enzyme that bacteria need to maintain their chromosome structure.
  * Penicillin, ampicillin, bacitracin: disrupt cell wall synthesis, which is absent in animals anyway.

## Microscopic World of Cells
* Organisms are either single-celled, or multi-celled (plants, most fungi, animals)
* Microscopes:
  * Simplest (and the first kind to be used): light microscope. Useful for observing living cells.
  * Two important factors: magnification and resolving power.
  * Electron microscopes have about 100x more resolving power than light microscopes, but they involve killing the specimen and preserving it with a chemical fixative first. 
  * Scanning electron microscope: for cell surface
  * Transmission electron microscope: for cell internals
* **Cell theory**: All living things are composed of cells and all cells come from earlier cells

## Major Categories of Cells
* Prokaryotic:
  * Smaller, simpler
  * Lack membrane-bound organelles
  * Found in bacteria and archaea
  * Cytoplasm: entire cell interior
  * Single circular chromosome in the nucleoid region.
  * First evolved around 3.5B years ago.
  * Most by cell walls, some have capsules, pili and/or flagella. (Pili: short hair-like appendages, flagella: long, helical appendages that protrude through the cell membrane)
* Eukaryotic:
  * Larger, more complex
  * Have membrane-bound organelles. (most important difference, incl. nucleus, which is double-membraned, houses most of the cell DNA)
  * Found in protists, fungi, animals, plants.
  * Cytoplasm: region between nucleus and plasma membrane
  * One or more linear chromosomes
  * First evolved around 2.1B years ago
  * Plant cells are surrounded by cell walls, animal: extracellular matrix
* All cells:
  * Plasma membrane: boundary, regulates traffic in and out of cells.
  * Inside cells: thick, jelly-like fluid: **cytosol** (all cellular components are suspended in it.)
  * One or more chromosomes, and have ribosomes (but structure differs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes)

> [!NOTE]
> * Pili: short hair-like appendages, but not membrane-bound organelles (surface-bound external filaments). Some pili: capable of extension and retraction. Can exchange DNA, so it used for sexual reproduction in bacteria.
> * Cilia: shorter hair-like appendages. Only found in Eukaryotic cells, and only they move with the help of cilia.
> * Flagella: Not membrane-bound organelles, helical appendages that protrude through the cell membrane. Some special flagella: sensory organs that can sense changes in pH and temperature.
> * Refer to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680979/#:~:text=The%20bacterial%20flagellar%20motor%20is,revolutions%20per%20second%20in%20E.) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nZYlyFGm50) for flagellar movement 

> [!NOTE]
> * Bacterial capsule: hydrated polysaccharide structure that covers the outer layer of the cell wall, mostly composed with monosaccharides via glycosidic, but sometimes amino acids, and protein-carbohydrate capsules are also found.
> * Extracellular matrix: Structural support network with diverse proteins, sugars, and other compounds.

## Overview of Eukaryotic Cells
* Differences in the organelles of plant and animal cells:
  * Plants: Central vacuole, cell wall, chloroplast
    * Central vacuole: Sac-like, surrounded by a phospholipid membrane. Functions as a storage tank for water (regulating turgor pressure) and other molecules, including toxic compounds at times like *nicotine* and *calcium oxalate* making them toxic to certain predators.
    * Cell wall: Rigid external layer, mainly composed of cellulose microfibrils.
    * Chloroplast: Well, learn it in detail in the photosynthesis chapter.
  * Animals: Centrioles, Lysosomes
    * Centrioles: Paired barrel-shaped organelles (one pair forms a centrosome), organize microtubules that serve as the cell's skeletal system.Help determine the locations of nucleus and other organelles. In plant cells, origin of spindle fibres is not that well known, in animals, they extend from centrioles.
    * Lysosomes: will be covered.
